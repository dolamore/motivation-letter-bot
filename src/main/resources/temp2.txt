Instruction for generating the motivational letter:

    Use only the experiences and skills that are real and described in the "Information about me"
    section and are most relevant to the role described in the vacancy description.

    For explaining my motivation use the “My motivation” section.
    For information about the company and product use “Company/product info” section.
    For information about vacancy use “Vacancy description” section.

    The body part of a letter should consist of three logical parts:

    → Summary;
    → Target description of experience;
    → Motivation.

    1. Summary. The summary is a short description of your professional experience on 5-7 lines. The summary chronology:
     the total number of years in the field, the logic of career growth, your three main hard competencies.
     Just as important as in a résumé, examples of real companies/clients and numbers. Take the information for this
     summary in the “Information about me” section (there is an overall summary, but also something relevant could be
     in the work experience part, consider using it all)

    Example #1
    10+ years of experience in marketing in large international and Russian companies (automotive industry, real estate).
     He began his career in the representative offices of German automobile concerns BMW and Porsche
     as a product marketing manager, then headed the Digital departments at Kia and Sminex.
     Key competencies — launching new products/brands to the market and localizing them, launching loyalty programs
     and building omnichannel systems from scratch.
     Experience in managing a team of up to 20 people and an annual budget of up to $1 million.

    Example #2
    I have been working in medicine for 15 years, 8 of which were in management positions at various levels,
    from managing a small branch of a dental clinic to managing a large business unit that unites 6 branches in 4 cities in Russia.
    I have experience in managing a team of up to 10 people under direct subordination and a budget of up to 100 million rubles.

    2. Target description of experience. To write this part, you need to:
    → carefully read the requirements in the position description
    → select 3-4 most important points from there
    → describe your experience in such a way that it shows how you used your competencies specified in the requirements.
    You could find relevant information in the “Vacancy description” section and “Information about me” section

    Example #1
    Requirement: experience in project management in the IT field for at least 3 years.
    In the cover letter: write short descriptions of the projects you have completed, launched, and developed.

    Example #2
    Requirement: ability to set up and analyze experiments.
    In the cover letter: describe what experiments you have done (A/B, A/A, A/B/C, etc.),
    what metrics you have analyzed, what criteria you have applied, what tools you have used for analysis.

    3. Motivation. Applicants often skimp on the motivation section, but in vain.
    Motivation is an indicator of the candidate’s intelligence and interest.
    Good motivation is usually based on one of the following points:

    → The company’s product. For example, you like the company’s product, you use it yourself,
    it brings you value, and you sincerely want to make this product with the company.

    → Industries. For example, you have worked on the consulting or agency side,
    have extensive knowledge of the market/successful cases,
    and are ready to apply the accumulated experience on the client side.

    → Career challenge. For example, the position you are applying for is your next career step.
    You have never held this position before, but you know you are ready and able, and this is your career challenge.
